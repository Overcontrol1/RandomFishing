# Random Fishing

This simple mod adds an enchantment for fishing rods that causes fished up items to be random.

Items are fished up in random amounts.

The enchantment is not compatible with Luck of the Sea.

Uses [Polymer](https://github.com/Patbox/polymer) to be completely serverside, and only optional on the client.
