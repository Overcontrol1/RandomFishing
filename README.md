# Random Fishing

## About

This simple mod adds an enchantment for fishing rods that causes fished up items to be random.

Items are fished up in random amounts.

The enchantment is not compatible with Luck of the Sea.

Uses [Polymer](https://modrinth.com/mod/polymer) to be completely serverside, and only optional on the client.

## Configuration

The max amount fished up can be modified with the gamerule _randomFishingMaxCount_.

Individual items may be blacklisted through the item tag `randomfishing:blacklist`. See [this wiki page](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Tag) for more information on tags.

A modwide blacklist is available through a JSON file, found at `data/randomfishing/blacklist.json`. This file should contain only a JSON array of strings - the mod IDs of each blacklisted mod.
